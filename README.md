## Introduction

In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. In this project, what we need is to understand how genetic algorithm and use it in problem solving.
In the process of constructing the Game of Life, we built the offspring, genotypes and the environment in genetic algorithm. Also, we designed the algorithm of fitness, the crossover algorithm, the evolution algorithm and the mutation algorithm for our own genetic algorithm. 


## Background

The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. For this project, we need to use genetic algorithm to find an infinite growing and acyclic pattern for this game.
